/**
 * Puts the repository's own `CHANGELOG.md` on the docs site.
 *
 * There is one changelog and it lives at the repository root, where a reader
 * browsing the repository and every package tool already expects to find it. Keeping a second
 * copy under `docs/` would be two files that say the same thing until the day
 * one of them does not, so the docs' copy is generated instead — written before
 * VitePress starts and ignored by git.
 *
 * The only thing added is the frontmatter: the sidebar reads `title` for the
 * label and `order` for where it sits, and the source file cannot carry either
 * without npm and GitHub rendering it as a stray table at the top.
