/**
 * The inline half of `::: fw` — a few words that differ, in the middle of a
 * sentence that does not.
 *
 * `<Fw react="onClick" flutter="onPressed" code />`
 *
 * A container cannot do this: `:::` is a block, and splitting a sentence into
 * two blocks to swap one identifier inside it would leave two paragraphs where
 * there was one. Anything longer than a phrase belongs in the block form.
 *
 * Each framework's text arrives as an attribute named after its id, read off
 * `$attrs` rather than declared, so adding a framework stays one entry in
 * `data/frameworks.ts`. One with nothing given for it renders nothing, which is
 * how a clause only one of them has gets written.
