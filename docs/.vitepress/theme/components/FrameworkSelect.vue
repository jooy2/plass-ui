/**
 * The language switch, at the top of the sidebar.
 *
 * It sits above the menu rather than in the navbar because it is not
 * navigation: it does not take the reader anywhere, it changes what the page
 * they are already on says. The sidebar is where the rest of that scoping
 * lives, and on mobile the drawer carries it along.
 *
 * A segmented control rather than a `<select>`, and the reason is not that a
 * select is ugly. There are exactly two options, both are always worth showing,
 * and the choice colours every page on the site — a control that hides one of
 * its two states behind a click is the wrong shape for a decision that
 * important, and a popup list of two items is a popup for nothing.
 *
 * Built out of real radio inputs, hidden and labelled. That is what buys the
 * arrow keys, the group semantics and the focus behaviour for free; a row of
 * `<button>`s would need a roving tabindex written by hand to be as good, and
 * it would be worse.

/*
 * Which option the radios say is chosen — and it is deliberately behind the
 * page for one tick.
 *
 * The pre-rendered HTML is built with the default selected, because that is all
 * a build can know. `syncFramework()` then runs in `enhanceApp`, *before*
 * hydration, so by the time this component first renders in the browser it
 * already holds the stored choice — and a first render that disagrees with the
 * server's DOM is precisely what Vue does not repair: hydration patches event
 * handlers and `value`, and leaves `checked` and `class` as the server wrote
 * them. Nothing changes afterwards, so nothing is ever patched, and a reader
 * who picked Flutter came back to a page in Flutter with React ticked.
 *
 * Rendering the default first and correcting it in `onMounted` makes the
 * correction an ordinary update, which Vue does apply. What the eye reads
 * meanwhile is not this at all — the active option is drawn from
 * `html[data-fw]`, which the inline head script sets before the first paint —
 * so the tick is right for assistive technology and the arrow keys, the
 * highlight is right immediately, and neither has to wait for the other.
