/**
 * The stylesheet half of the build.
 *
 * `tsc` only emits JavaScript, so nothing under `src/` that ends in `.css`
 * reaches `dist/` on its own. This runs last in `npm run build` and writes the
 * two files the package exports:
 *
 *   src/standalone.css  --(Tailwind)-->  dist/styles.css     `plass-ui/styles.css`
 *   src/styles.css      --(copy)------>  dist/tailwind.css   `plass-ui/tailwind.css`
 *
 * The names cross over, and deliberately so. `plass-ui/styles.css` is the one line
 * a project with no build-side Tailwind imports, so it has to be the obvious
 * name; `src/styles.css` is the token sheet, which is only *part* of it.
 *
 * Compiling here rather than in the consumer's build is what removes Tailwind
 * from their install entirely: `tailwindcss` is a devDependency of this package
 * and stays one. The scan is driven by the `@source '.'` inside `src/styles.css`
 * — the same line that, in the copied file, means `node_modules/plass-ui/dist/`
 * for a consumer who does run Tailwind. One declaration serves both outputs.
