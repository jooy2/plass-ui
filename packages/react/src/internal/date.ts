/**
 * The arithmetic and the naming the four pickers share.
 *
 * No date library under it, deliberately. Plass has one runtime dependency —
 * Base UI — and a component library that quietly adds `date-fns`, or worse
 * picks a side in the dayjs/luxon/Temporal argument on its consumer's behalf,
 * has made a decision that was not its to make. Everything here is either
 * `Date` arithmetic, which is a dozen lines, or `Intl`, which the platform
 * already ships and which knows more about month names in more languages than
 * any bundled table ever will.
 *
 * **That is also the whole of the localisation story.** There is no table of
 * translated month names to import and no per-language module to register: the
 * only strings a picker says that `Intl` has no opinion about are the labels on
 * its own buttons, and those are one `labels` prop with English defaults. A
 * project that ships in twelve languages pays nothing for eleven of them.
 *
 * Two rules hold everywhere below:
 *
 * - **Local time, always.** A calendar day is a thing a person is looking at on
 *   a wall, not an instant on a line. `makeDate(2026, 6, 27)` is midnight local
 *   and every comparison here is made on the local Y/M/D triple, so a picker in
 *   Seoul and a picker in São Paulo both light up the cell that says 27.
 * - **Nothing is mutated.** `Date` is mutable and every method on it that
 *   sounds like a question is actually a command. Each function here copies
 *   first, so a `value` handed in by a caller is never the object that comes
 *   back out.
