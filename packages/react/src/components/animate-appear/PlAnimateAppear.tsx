/**
 * A list of things settling into place one after another.
 *
 * Each child takes the same short drift and fade, held back by its position — so
 * the effect belongs to the *set* rather than to any one item, and a reader's
 * eye is walked down the list in the order it should be read.
 *
 * The animation is written onto the children themselves rather than onto
 * wrappers around them. A row of `<li>`s stays a row of `<li>`s, a grid's cells
 * stay its direct children, and nothing about the layout changes because the
 * list is being animated. Only a bare string has no element to write onto, so
 * that one is wrapped in a `<span>`.
 *
 * The stagger is per *child*, which means what you pass matters: eight children
 * are eight steps, and one child holding eight things is one step. That is also
 * how to opt part of a list out — group it.
