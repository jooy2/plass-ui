/// Where a small control can be pressed from.

/// WCAG 2.5.8 asks for a target at least 24 logical pixels square. The × on a
/// chip and on a picker trigger is drawn smaller than that, and drawing it
/// larger would make the chip or the trigger larger with it. So the drawing
/// stays where it is and the press is moved instead: a press anywhere in the
/// square around a [PlassTarget] is handed on as a press in the middle of it.
///
/// It takes two widgets rather than one because a box is only asked about a
/// press inside its own size, and so is every box above it. The × sits in a row
/// as tall as its line of text, so a margin it claimed round itself would never
/// be asked about. [PlassTargetScope] goes round the whole control, which is.
///
/// None of this is exported from `plass_ui.dart` — it is the library talking to
