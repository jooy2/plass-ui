/// Flutter `Image` resolves its provider as soon as it is mounted, so a gallery
/// of sixty photographs asks for sixty decodes before any of them is on screen
/// — and a gallery is the one place in the library that builds a list of
/// pictures rather than one.
///
/// Laziness needs a viewport, and `PlGallery` has none: it sizes itself to its
/// content and the app scrolls it. So what is read here is the nearest
/// [Scrollable] above, and a gallery with none is built whole, as it was.
///
/// What is held back is the picture and not the tile. Every layout the gallery
/// draws knows each tile's box from the item's own `ratio`, never from the file,
/// so the board is laid out exactly as before and nothing moves when a picture
/// arrives.
///
/// It is not exported from `plass_ui.dart`.
