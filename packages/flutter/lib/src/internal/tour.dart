/// A clip and not a painted ring, and that is the decision the whole widget

/// target, and it buys nothing else: the corners of a four-piece scrim never
/// quite meet, and the seams show as hairlines the moment the dimming is
/// anything but opaque. A clip buys two things instead:
///
/// **The dimming can blur.** A [BackdropFilter] inside a [ClipPath] blurs the
/// screen everywhere the scrim is painted and nowhere it is not, so the page
/// around the light is out of focus rather than merely grey — which is this
/// library's own material.
///
/// **The hole is a hole for the pointer too.** [ClipPath] clips hit testing as
/// well as painting, so the scrim can take the pointer everywhere it is painted
/// and nowhere it is not. The reader can use the control being pointed at and
/// nothing else, which is what separates a tour from a dialog with a picture of
/// a control in it — and it falls out of the geometry rather than being a
/// second mechanism that has to agree with it.
///
/// A `null` [spot] is a step with no target: the whole screen dims and nothing
/// is cut out, which is what a welcome step and a closing step are.
