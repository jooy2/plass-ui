/// Takes the system back for a layer while [active] is on.
///
/// The system back is Android's back button and gesture, TalkBack's back, and
/// VoiceOver's escape scrub, all of which reach the app as the same request:
/// pop the page on top. A layer lifted into the [Overlay] is not a page, so
/// without this the request passes it by and pops the page under it, and the
/// layer goes with the page without ever saying it was closed.
///
/// So while it is [active] the layer is registered with the [ModalRoute] it sits
/// in, as a `PopScope` is, and that route refuses to be popped and tells the
/// guard instead. Only while it is active: a guard sits round every popup,
/// tooltips included, and a route tells the platform whether the app answers
/// the back every time an entry comes or goes.
///
/// Only the layer on top answers. A route tells every entry it holds, and a
/// modal opened from a modal would otherwise close both on one back. The one on
/// top is the one that took the back last, which is the one whose layer went up
/// last and is painted over the others.
///
/// A layer on a page something else has been pushed over is not asked, because
/// the back pops the page on top. With no route above it at all, an app that
/// has an [Overlay] and no [Navigator], there is no back to take, and the guard
/// does nothing.
