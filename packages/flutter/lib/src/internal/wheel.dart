/// the box has no use for that direction: a horizontal [Scrollable] reads the
/// horizontal half of a scroll and a mouse only ever produces the vertical one,
/// so the shelf under the pointer sits still while whatever is behind it moves
/// instead. The pointer being on the strip is the reader saying which of the two
/// things under it they meant to move, and [turn] is what acts on that.
///
/// [overscroll] is the second half, and it is the end of the strip rather than
/// the middle of it. A scroller that has run out hands the rest of the gesture
/// to whatever is behind it, and the reader who was flicking a shelf along gets
/// the whole page moving instead — without having asked for it, and usually
/// without having seen which pixel it happened at.
///
/// Everything goes through the [PointerSignalResolver] rather than being acted
/// on where it arrives. A scroll view that has claimed the same event is deeper
/// in the hit test and registers first, so the strip's own [Scrollable] moves it
/// and this does not move it again; and a claim that does nothing at all is what
/// keeps an ancestor from taking a signal the strip has decided to hold.
