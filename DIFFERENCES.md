# Differences between the builds

Small differences between the React and the Flutter builds of the same component, found during the audit of both packages from 2026-09-13 to 2026-09-28. Each was recorded rather than fixed, because a reader would not call either build broken: a pixel of size, a colour a step apart, a change that eases in one build and happens at once in the other, or a detail of the keyboard or the semantics that only a close comparison shows.

Line numbers are from the commit that found each difference and drift as the code changes; when one no longer matches, search for the symbol. A difference that is closed later is deleted from this list.

- Charts: Flutter draws no category-axis rule (`tokens.chartAxis` is read nowhere), where React draws one at the zero line in `--plass-chart-axis` (`ChartAxes` in `chart-frame.tsx`).
- Charts: React draws the zero gridline in `--plass-chart-baseline`, Flutter every gridline in `chartGrid` (`chart_frame.dart` ~1794-1810).
- `PlScatterChart`: Flutter draws no vertical gridlines, React draws them when the x axis measures (`categoryGrid`).
- `PlAreaChart`: a stacked Flutter area has no 2px surface line between bands (React `chart-line.tsx` ~235).
- Charts: a faded series' value labels fade in React (inside the series `<g>`) and stay whole in Flutter (`_paintValueLabels`, `chart_line.dart` ~220).
- Charts: Flutter replaces the alpha of a series or point colour it is given (`chart_line.dart` ~89, the scatter fill, `pl_bar_chart.dart` ~351, `pl_pie_chart.dart` ~752), where React keeps it.
- `PlHeatmapChart`: the Flutter card sits 8px higher than the React one (`pl_heatmap_chart.dart` ~468 and `chart_frame.dart` ~2724, against `chart-frame.tsx` ~715).
- Charts: `markers: auto` counts each series' own points in React (`chart-line.tsx` ~266) and the chart's categories in Flutter (`chart_line.dart` ~58-60), so a short series on a long chart has markers in React only.
- Charts: when the legend lets go, the React `mask` that keeps a faded line out of its markers goes at once while the series' opacity eases back, so the line shows through its markers for about 150ms (`chart-line.tsx`, the band `<g>`).
